#### FTPS with command line

{% highlight bash %}
lftp -c 'open -e "set ftps:initial-prot "";    set ftp:ssl-force true;    set ftp:ssl-protect-data true;    put test.txt; "    -u "USERNAME","PASSWORD"    ftp://IP:PORT '
{% endhighlight%}

Internal ip doesn't work since we have a redirection in passive mode (PASV) and that is done to public ip of the server. 
That is because the public ips of our servers are not accessible within VPN.

Port is often 21.
