### Easy search in JIRA

Create following search engine entries in Chrome:

* `JIRA ABC Search` - `abc` - `https:/jira.mycompany.com/browse/ABC-%s`
* `JIRA DEF Search` - `def` - `https:/jira.mycompany.com/browse/DEF-%s`
* `JIRA Issue Search` - `jira` - `https:/jira.mycompany.com/browse/%s`
* `JIRA Text Search` - `jiratext` - `https:/jira.mycompany.com/issues?jql=text~"%s"`

For example, type "abc" in the address box and press `TAB`. Then type your issue number and press enter.
You will be in that issue.
